# Mastercard Cybersecurity Virtual Experience.

Simulated Security Analyst Role—Phishing Simulation &amp; Awareness Campaign.

- This self-paced virtual experience simulated working as a Security Analyst on Mastercard's Security Awareness Team, designed as part of The Forage's job simulation platform (1–2 hours of guided tasks).

- I examined and improved a phishing email to make it more convincing, gaining hands-on insight into how phishing operates and why it poses serious risks to organizations. I then developed a simulated phishing campaign—crafting multiple email templates and analyzed campaign performance, including metrics like response rates and vulnerabilities across teams. Based on the results, I designed phishing prevention training, blending real-world examples and interactive content to enhance security awareness and reduce future risks.

- I enhanced my technical security awareness and design thinking, and honed my problem-solving, data analysis, and communication skills through this simulation. I completed the simulation independently and earned a certificate, which boosted my confidence in interview discussions and gave me tangible experience to showcase on my resume and LinkedIn.
